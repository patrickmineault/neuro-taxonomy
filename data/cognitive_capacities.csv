Capacity,Description
Planning,"The capacity, associated primarily with the prefrontal cortex, to generate and evaluate sequences of future actions in service of achieving goals, involving the integration of memory, current state representations, and anticipated outcomes."
Logical Reasoning,"A deliberative cognitive process mediated by prefrontal and parietal circuits that enables the derivation of conclusions from premises through systematic inference and multi-step problem decomposition."
Decision-making,"The evaluative process by which the frontal cortex, in conjunction with the basal ganglia, weighs potential outcomes, rewards, and risks to select among competing action alternatives."
Working Memory,"A capacity of the prefrontal cortex to actively maintain and manipulate limited information in a readily accessible state for ongoing cognitive operations such as reasoning or planning."
Cognitive Flexibility,"A frontal executive function that enables the dynamic shifting of strategies, perspectives, or task sets in response to changing environmental demands or goal states."
Inhibitory Control,"The prefrontal capacity to suppress prepotent or contextually inappropriate responses, enabling self-regulation of behavior in accordance with internal goals rather than external stimuli."
Social Functions,"Network-level capacities involving frontal and limbic structures that enable navigation of interpersonal contexts, including cooperation, communication, and the coordination of behavior with conspecifics."
Empathy,"A social-emotional capacity dependent on medial and orbitofrontal cortex interacting with limbic structures that enables the vicarious experience and understanding of others' affective states."
Theory of Mind,"The ability, reliant on prefrontal-limbic networks, to attribute mental states—beliefs, intentions, desires—to other agents and to use these attributions to predict and interpret their behavior."
Self-reflection,"A metacognitive capacity involving prefrontal regions that enables the monitoring and evaluation of one's own internal states, cognitive processes, and behavioral outputs."
Reward Mechanisms,"The dopaminergic circuitry of the basal ganglia that encodes reward prediction errors to reinforce behaviors leading to valued outcomes."
Multisensory Integration,"A function of parietal association cortex and subcortical structures that combines information from distinct sensory modalities (visual, auditory, somatosensory) into unified perceptual representations."
Spatial Representation and Mapping,"The parietal and hippocampal capacity to construct allocentric and egocentric spatial representations of the environment, supporting navigation and the localization of objects."
Attention,"A thalamocortical mechanism, coordinated by frontal-parietal networks, that modulates sensory gain to selectively amplify task-relevant information while suppressing distractors."
Sensorimotor Coordination,"The parietal-mediated transformation between sensory coordinate frames and motor coordinate frames that enables visually-guided reaching, grasping, and other goal-directed movements."
Tactile Perception,"The somatosensory cortical processing of cutaneous and proprioceptive signals that enables discrimination of texture, pressure, temperature, and body position in space."
Visual Perception,"The hierarchical processing within the occipital cortex and ventral stream that transforms retinal input into progressively abstract representations of edges, shapes, colors, and object identities."
Scene Understanding / Visual Reasoning,"The capacity, extending beyond primary visual areas into temporal and parietal association cortex, to extract spatial relationships, contextual meaning, and causal structure from visual scenes."
Visual Attention and Eye Movements,"The oculomotor system's coordination with parietal-frontal attention networks to direct gaze toward behaviorally relevant stimuli and sequentially sample the visual environment."
Language Comprehension,"The temporal lobe capacity to map acoustic or visual linguistic signals onto semantic representations and compositional meaning."
Language Production,"The frontal capacity, dependent on premotor and motor speech regions, to transform semantic and syntactic representations into articulated speech or written output."
Face Recognition,"A specialized function of the temporal cortex that enables rapid identification of individual conspecifics from facial configurations."
Auditory Processing,"The temporal cortical analysis of acoustic signals in the temporal lobe that extracts frequency, timing, and spectral features underlying speech, music, and environmental sound recognition."
Episodic Memory,"The hippocampal-dependent capacity to encode, consolidate, and retrieve context-rich representations of specific autobiographical events bound in space and time."
Lifelong Learning,"The capacity for continual knowledge acquisition and skill refinement across the lifespan without catastrophic interference with previously learned information, enabled by complementary hippocampal and neocortical memory systems."
Semantic Understanding & Context Recognition,"The temporal association cortex capacity to store and retrieve conceptual knowledge about objects, facts, and word meanings independent of specific encoding episodes."
Adaptive Error Correction,"The cerebellar function of using sensory feedback about movement errors to progressively calibrate motor commands, enabling smooth, accurate, and coordinated action."
Skill Learning,"The gradual acquisition, mediated by basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits, of procedural knowledge through practice until performance becomes automatic and habitual."
Motor Coordination,"The cerebellar fine-tuning of movement parameters—timing, force, trajectory—to ensure smooth, accurate, and well-sequenced motor output across muscle groups."
Cognitive Timing & Predictive Modeling,"The cerebellar capacity to generate precise temporal predictions about upcoming sensory events and motor requirements, enabling anticipatory preparation and coordination."
Reflexive Responses,"Brainstem-mediated, fast, stereotyped motor outputs triggered automatically by specific sensory inputs without requiring cortical deliberation."
Autonomic Regulation,"The brainstem and hypothalamic control of visceral functions—heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature—that maintain physiological homeostasis."
Arousal & Attention States,"The reticular activating system's modulation of global cortical excitability that regulates the sleep-wake continuum and determines overall alertness and vigilance levels."
Motivational Drives,"The hypothalamic generation of internal need states (hunger, thirst, thermoregulation) that create action-initiating signals directing behavior toward homeostatic restoration."
